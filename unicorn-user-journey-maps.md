# UNICORN USER JOURNEY MAPS

## INTRODUCTION

These comprehensive user journey maps document the experience of Unicorn's key stakeholders as they engage with the platform. By mapping each phase of interaction—from initial awareness through full advocacy—these journey maps identify critical touchpoints, emotional states, pain points, and opportunities to optimize the user experience.

The document covers four primary user journeys:
1. **Founder Journey**: The primary startup team experience
2. **Investor Journey**: The capital provider perspective
3. **Service Provider Journey**: The experience of marketplace participants
4. **Enterprise Partner Journey**: The journey of corporate and institutional users

Each journey is analyzed across awareness, consideration, onboarding, adoption, and advocacy phases, with specific attention to user needs, expectations, and success factors at each stage.

These journey maps provide a blueprint for experience design, content strategy, feature prioritization, and touchpoint optimization throughout the Unicorn platform.
